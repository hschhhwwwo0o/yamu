The application is designed for creating mock-ups. Create product mock-ups with the online mock-up generator. Simply select a mock-up, upload your design and download a watermark-free image.

## Development

Tracking of tasks was done using GitHub Projects (ðŸ‘Ž).

The development of the project was divided into several stages:

1. Development of software requirements
2. Design development
3. Module development
4. Application development

### 1. Development of software requirements

Before starting to develop the code base, the requirements to the software product were thought over. Functional and user requirements, quality attributes were formulated; a data dictionary and a dictionary of terms were compiled.

A unique identifier is created for each requirement. At the stage of code writing, the identifier of the implemented requirement is noted in the comment, which makes it easier to find the implementation of a particular requirement in the code base. In the book "Software Requirements Engineering" by Carl Wiegers and Jay Beatty, this approach is called _requirement tracking_. To find anything related to a particular requirement use the codebase search (â‡§âŒ˜F) and enter the requirement ID. For example:

![Example](./md/RequirmentsIDsPreview4.png)

### 2. Design development

The design of the application was developed in Figma/Photoshop. The design was developed in accordance with the previously developed software requirements.

### 3. Module development

The project is separated into modules and application; modules are responsible for implementing the business logic; application is responsible for rendering the UI and executing the business logic through the modules. Thus, the application (in this case, the NextJS framework) is responsible only for displaying the UI, while the modules contain all the business logic. _Each module performs only one task and should not interact with other modules in any way_.

The purpose of this separation is to separate business logic from fickle and windy frameworks and libraries that have nothing to do with business logic. The modules are designed in such a way that they can be used independently of the framework; this makes it very easy to migrate from ReactJS to VueJS, for example.

If you're using macOS or Linux (I really hope you're not a Windows userÂ¹ ðŸ‘Ž), you can use the tool to quickly create and configure a new module; run this command in the root of the project:

```sh
bash ./instruments/module_creator.bash
```

At the moment there are 3 modules implemented in the project:

| Module name            | Meaning of the module                                                                                                    |
| :--------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| @mock-up-html-renderer | A module designed to display a mock-up on an HTML page using canvas. Includes rendering and downloading the final image. |
| @mock-up-generator     | The module is intended for mock-up state management. Includes device selection, image insertion, device settings.        |
| @feedback-creator      | The module is intended for sending feedback by the user.                                                                 |

<ins>Detailed descriptions of the modules and examples of their use are provided in the modules' documentation.</ins>

To change the logic of module operation and check the result of its work in the application, you need to recompile the module. This can be done using the build_modules script; execute this command in the root of the project:

```sh
npm run build-modules
```

If something went wrong, you can compile the modules yourself. To compile a module yourself, go to the module folder and execute the compile command:

```sh
npm run compile
```

### 4. Application development

Creating an application UI and using already developed modules in it.

### Installation and start dev server

To install the repository, paste this command into your terminal:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/hschhhwwwo0o/yamu.git
```

If you are a macOS or Linux user, (I REALLY HOPE YOU'RE NOT A WINDOWS USERÂ¹ ðŸ‘Ž) the project installation is done in 1 line of code in the terminal; to install application and module dependencies, copy this command and run it in the project root:

```sh
bash instruments/project_installer.bash
```

_If the install script gives an error (OR IF YOU ARE A WINDOWS USERÂ¹ ðŸ‘Ž), you must install the module dependencies yourself, compile the modules, install the application dependencies, and install husky to install it._

Start the dev server using the command in the root of the project:

```sh
npm run dev
```

## Dictionary of Terms

Â«A dictionary of terms defines all the specialized terms that the reader needs to know in order to properly understand the software requirements specificationÂ»

<ins>_Â«Development of software requirementsÂ», Third Edition. Carl Vigers, Jay Beatty_</ins>

The term dictionary is intended to ensure that the same terms are used throughout the code base. For example, to eliminate the use of synonym words.

## Software requirements

Â«Requirements are a specification of what needs to be implemented. They describe the behavior of the system, the properties of the system or its attributes. They can serve as constraints in the system development process.Â»

### Quality Attributes

Â«Quality attributes describe the characteristics observed during software execution. They strongly influence the perception of the system by users and the opinion that users have about its quality.Â»

## Remarks

Â¹ If you are a Windows user, you can probably use WSL to work with unix commands.
